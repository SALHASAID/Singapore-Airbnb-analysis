# Singapore-Airbnb-analysis
An analysis of Airbnb listings in Singapore to uncover insights into pricing trends, popular neighborhoods, and room types. This project includes SQL queries for data analysis and visualization



OVERVIEW
This project involves the analysis of an Airbnb dataset for Singapore. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and cleaned using Python. The analysis was performed using SQL, and visualizations were created using Power BI.



DATA CLEANING
The dataset contained inconsistencies and duplicates which were addressed during the cleaning process. Items that did not significantly impact the analysis were removed. Additionally, due to excessive duplicates in the "name" column, it was removed, and a new column called "id" was added to provide unique identifiers.
